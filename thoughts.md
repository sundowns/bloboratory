# Thoughts for gamers

## Themes

* You are a crazy alchemist.
* You are trying to contain the byproducts of your crazy experiments
* Games take no more than 15-20 minutes.

## Mechanics

* Mazing Tower defense.
* Game is broken into rounds, started by the player. Between rounds the player has time to build whatever they want.
* Building is disabled between rounds, but there are controls to change game speed.
* Player unlocks new base towers/mutations each round.
* Initially unlocks will be a flat selection, stretch goal to add tech tree.
* Blueprint/base of a tower is the mechanical component.
* Mutation/augment of a tower is the alchemical component.
* Towers will only be a combination of a base and a mutator.
* Start with 2 mechanical tower unlocks + 1 mutation unlock.
* Gain 1 of either every round.
* If x number of leak in the game, game over - FBI agents bust ya
* Enemies have a base armour value, which is just damage reduction (flat or %??)

## Visuals

* Top-down, flat perspective.
* Thinking 32x32 pixel art for now.
* Animations stored in a spritesheet, with rows dedicate to the frames of a single animation.

## Base Towers

* Mazing block - some simple throwaway to block enemies (salt lines, crates, etc?).
* Sawblade - fast, weak melee attack.
* Hammer - slow, strong melee attack (with some short ranged).
* Catapult/Trebuchet - slow, strong ranged attack.
* Potato gun/idk - fast, weak ranged attack.
* Desk fan - slow down enemies in a straight line.

## Mutations

* Electricity - High variance spike damage.
* Fire - Slow, but chunky DoT.
* Poison/Acid - Weaker DoT that ignores armour.
* Cold - Applies a slow effect,Fast, but weaker no damage change.

## Enemies

* Armour value - flat(?) damage reduction
* Health value
* Speed value

## Stretch Goals

* Random dispersing of obstacle tiles to mix-up tower placement/strategy each time
* On-path, non-obstacle towers.
* Tiers of base towers.
* Boss monsters to unlock new tech.
* Combine mutators
* Difficulty settings
* Base random obstacles with effects (+ aoe fire damage etc)
* Saving game state
* Damage type strengths/weaknesses
* Animate building of towers

## Title Ideas

* Full Mental Alchemist (Might be too derivative but I couldn't NOT leave it here)
